# 1. --- COUNT --- 
# Count allows you to perform counting the number of values of a specific field (no. of rows for a specific column)
# SYNTAX: tibble pipe-operator 
#         count(parameters)


# How many departures were delayed?
airline_satisfaction %>%
  # Filter departure delays that are more than 0 minutes
  filter(Departure.Delay > 0) %>%
  # Get the number of delays by departure delays in minutes
  count(Departure.Delay, sort = TRUE)


# Another way of counting
airline_satisfaction %>%
  # Group by allows you to groups samples / rows of data based of 1 or 2 columns
  group_by(Age) %>%
  summarize(number_of_passengers = n())



# 2.--- SUMMARIZE --- 
# Summarize allows you to collapse a large dataset to a single observation
# Summarize is similar to Aggregation
# SYNTAX: tibble pipe-operator 
#         summarize(parameters)

# What is the range of flight delays and the average of flight distances?

# What is the total flight distance by Class and Type of Travel?
airline_satisfaction %>%
  # Group and summarize to find the total distance

# How many passenger ages travel longer for business than personal?
